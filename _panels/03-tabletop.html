</p>


<h4>Actual Rules</h4>
<ol>
    <li>The GM always has the final say.</li>
    <ul start="2" style="margin: 0;">
        <li>The GM sometimes knows more than you, listen to what they have to say.</li>
        <li>If an argument breaks out about rules, characters, etc. In the interest of time, the GM shall give the final ruling. These temporary rules last for the entire game session and will be reviewed after.</li>
        <li>This however, does NOT give the GM power to abuse the players.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Be engaged.</li>
    <ul start="2" style="margin: 0;">
        <li>No phones at the table. *insert nick tapping all the buttons on his phone here*</li>
        <li>Be ready for your turn.</li>
        <li>Be active in the game.</li>
        <li>Keep good notes, preferably a player diary.</li>
        <li>No eating pencils or falling asleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul start="2" style="margin: 0;">
        <li>Roll the dice after saying what you are going to do.</li>
        <li>Add the correct modifiers.</li>
        <li>If you are not sure about something, ask the GM.</li>
        <li>Avoid metagaming as much as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Fun is more important than rules.</li>
    <ul start="2" style="margin: 0;">
        <li>Rules keep us organized and sane, however when rules start ruining the fun the GM should use discretion in order to make it fun again.</li>
        <li>Don’t shit all over the rules for a joke.</li>
    </ul>
