<h4>Story</h4>
<h5>Kassen, Nirmathas</h5>
<div>
    <strong>Crannor, Glanel, Virilion, and Erin join the party.</strong></br />
    The story starts in a small town known as Kassen when bandits try to shakedown the townsfolk. 
    Four adventurers: Crannor, Glanel, Virilion, and Erin are hired to take the fight to the bandits by the town.
    After Crannor screams an Orc war-cry the entire bandit camp lays down and cries, the towns small guard was then able to take care of them.
    Ereries (former bandit) decides to join the party.</br />
    <strong>Ereries joins the party.</strong></br />
    Afterwards we are informed by the towns Mayor that there is an ancient crypt near the town.
    Investigating the crypt, the party finds pillow pits, an arrow pillar thing, and an ancient Lich. The Lich sucks and gets his arms ripped off instantly and cut in half.
    The party finds an ancient sword in the crypt, meanwhile Glanel accidentally punches a dead body. Crannor knocks him out.
    The party returns to Kassen where they try to get an appraisal on the ancient sword looted in the crypt. The town blacksmith knows nothing about it.
    Glanel attempts an appraise check on it, and immediately botches, snapping the sword in half. 
    Glanel spots a masterwork axe and attempts to steal it, however is caught and thrown out of the shop in the process.
    Crannor buys a new great hammer, and Glannel challenges him to a fight with it. Immediately getting knocked out with it.
    The party receives a letter from the Pathfinder society asking them to come to Tamran, as they would like to hire them for a job.
    This leads the gang to board a boat on its way to Tamran.

<br /><br />
<h5>Tamran, Nirmathas</h5>
<div>
    On the way to Tamran, the party gets bored on the long and uneventful journey. Virilion decides he would to train with Crannor, this became known as THE QUEST TO BECOME HUUUUGE.
    This intense training session was cut short by a swarm of crabs who nearly wiped the party due to a long line of botches.
    Glanel attempts to punch the crabs but is ultimately ineffective, meanwhile Crannor tries to swing his new hammer at them, slipping in the process and falling face first into the swarm.
    As Crannor scrambles to get back up he slips yet again, and Virilion attempts to spray grease at the crabs to make them slip off the boat.
    This causes Glanel to slip, and Crannor to continue slipping. Virilion, seeing that these crabs have almost killed his fellow party members decides to jump off the boat and summon a dolphin to ride on.
    The dolphin is startled and throws him off. Erin and a stowaway save the day somehow (this was years ago, so I can't really remember how). 
    After the crabs have been dealt with there is a small time-skip to us arriving in Tamran.
    During this time-skip Crannor looses his Paladin powers, and realizes that something is very wrong with the state of the gods.
    As the boat approaches Tamran cultists from the religion of Razmir send a boarding party to our boat in order to shake us down for money to fuel their Holy war.
    Crannor snaps one of the cultists necks in a surprise attack, and a fight ensues. The cultists are killed.
    Once the boat lands in the town the party realizes that this Razmir cult has invaded the town and is extorting the townsfolk.
    Crannor leaves to go on a Holy crusade.</br />
    <strong>Crannor leaves the party.</strong></br />
